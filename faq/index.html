<h1>Askey FAQ</h1>

<h3>What are character packs?</h3>
<p>Come on now, throwing us a softball like that. Character packs are sets of characters that you can use to draw Askey art. We have a Text, Emoji, and Mail pack, each with fun differences.</p>

<h3>WTF is the Mail Pack for?</h3>
<p>For emails, obv. Also Venmo transactions. It works really well for Venmo transations. Watch out for their 2000 character memo limit, though!</p>
